# Script to map these Pfam domains in KEGG->User Data Mapping.
# Colors are proportional to the number of Pfam matches and normalized with respect to the max.
# Note that a reference map must be selected first. For instance, Sulphur metabolism is:
# http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00920
# WARNING: note that several K numbers might map to the same protein.
# These cases are coloured in KEGG with the color of the last given K number.
# You might want to manually adjust the colors to correct this.
